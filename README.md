# cs_wave
Wave encoding acquisition + compressed sensing reconstruction

This was code generated for the abstract (referece 1. down below): "Rapid CS-Wave acquisition with automated parameter selection"

What is this abstract about:

We compared CS-Wave, with this new way to determine the regularization weighting, 
to Wave-CAIPI (the standard) and to Wave-LORAKS (a completely different state-of-the-art method).
Results indicate the successful application of CS-Wave with uniform
undersampling because wave encoding transforms aliasing into noise-like
artifacts (much like spirals), and its reconstruction performance is better (or at least equal)
to other methods. Nonetheless, future work would be about implementing
a random sampling pattern on the Wave-MPRAGE sequence to improve reconstruction performance.
